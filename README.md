## Architecture

I have used MVI architecture for this app. Unidirection data flow helps and makes writing unit tests a breeze.

<br>

## Things that could have been improved the app

<ol>Shimmer effect for loading</ol>
<ol>Better icon and placeholder</ol>

<br>

## Stuff i wanted to do but didn't had time

UI and integration tests. This project has 0 UI and integration tests since i don't have good experience writing UI tests
