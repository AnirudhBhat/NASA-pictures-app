## Architecture

I have used MVI architecture for this app. Unidirection data flow helps and makes writing unit tests a breeze.

<br>

## Things that could have been improved the app

1. Shimmer effect for loading
2. Better icon and placeholder

<br>

## Stuff i wanted to do but didn't had time

UI and integration tests. This project has 0 UI and integration tests since i don't have good experience writing UI tests
